============
THE ART OPERATIONS CONCEPT: As a prolific, interdisciplinary artist with over 20 years professional experience, I have consistently run various iterations/versions of my own workspace, conceived and managed as a one-person production studio/manufacturing operation. Over the years, I have experimented with workspace/workflow management and essentially with the day-to-day operations of running a professional Atelier, as well as every other aspect of running a mature, professional artistic practice. What I have done is formalize my own methodologies and turned it into the "Art Operations" concept, which I present here as The "Art-Ops-In-A-Box" Repository as proof of concept.
